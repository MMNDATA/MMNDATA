I worked independently on a Kaggle competition, Spaceship Titanic, for my Predictive Analytics class project. This project can be found in the MMNDATA repository. I imputed, explored, and transformed data. I built logistic regression, naive bayes, and random forest models to predict with 78% accuracy which passengers were accidentally transported to an alternate dimension. In addition, you can also find a Design of Experiments and Statistical Analysis project in the Bey-Data repository. Rachel Jordan and I coded together on her computer so you'll see she committed the code. Lastly, please check out a statistical consulting project I worked on with Nikhita Nalla. I really enjoyed the process of cleaning and combining two messy datasets to enable hypothesis testing, statistical model building, and communicate our insights.
