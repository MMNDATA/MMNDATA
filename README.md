I worked independently on a Kaggle competition, Spaceship Titanic, for my Predictive Analytics class project. I imputed, explored, and transformed data. 
I built logistic regression, naive bayes, and random forest models to predict with 78% accuracy which passengers were accidentally transported to an 
alternate dimension. Enjoy!
